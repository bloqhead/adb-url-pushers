# Device URL Push Scripts

## Abstract
These scripts were created to allow you to push a website URL to Chrome on Android and Silk on Amazon Fire tablets.

## Usage

### Push to Chrome on Android
1. `cd` into the directory that contains the `url2android.sh` script
2. Run `./url2android.sh google.com` in your favorite terminal application

Make sure your device's screen is on and you should see Google Chrome open automatically with the website you specified. To open new tabs, use the steps outlined above with your desired URLs.

### Push to Silk on Amazon Fire:
1. `cd` into the directory that contains `url2silk.sh` script
2. Run `./url2silk.sh` in your favorite terminal application

### Run Globally
To make either of these scripts, move them into your `/usr/local/bin` directory. After you've done this, you should be able to run them as simply `url2silk` or `url2android`.
